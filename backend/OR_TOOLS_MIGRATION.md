# OR-Tools VRP Solver Migration

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Successfully replaced custom clustering + TSP algorithm with Google OR-Tools professional VRP solver.

## What Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- **Added**: `ortools>=9.10` to requirements.txt
- **Installed**: ortools 9.14.6206

### 2. New File: `app/vrp_solver.py`
Professional Vehicle Routing Problem solver with:

#### Features Implemented:
- ✅ **Capacity Constraints**: Weight limits per truck (default: 52,000 lbs)
- ✅ **Time Windows**: Maximum drive time per truck (default: 12 hours/720 min)
- ✅ **Service Time**: Automatic service time per stop (default: 30 min)
- ✅ **Node Dropping**: High-penalty system (100,000) for impossible locations
- ✅ **Time Optimization**: Optimizes for total time (not just distance)
- ✅ **Multiple Strategies**: 
  - First solution: PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
  - Local search: GUIDED_LOCAL_SEARCH
- ✅ **30-second time limit**: Ensures responsive optimization

#### Key Functions:
```python
solve_vrp(
    stops: List[Stop],
    depot_lat: float,
    depot_lng: float,
    distance_matrix: List[List[float]],
    duration_matrix: List[List[float]],
    max_weight_per_truck: float = 52000,
    max_drive_time_minutes: float = 720,
    service_time_per_stop_minutes: float = 30,
) -> List[Route]
```

### 3. Updated: `app/main.py`
- **Import Changed**: `from .route_optimizer import` → `from .vrp_solver import`
- **Function Changed**: `plan_routes()` → `solve_vrp()`
- **Removed Parameter**: `max_stops_per_truck` (OR-Tools handles this automatically)

### 4. Deprecated: `app/route_optimizer.py`
- Old clustering + TSP algorithm
- Kept in codebase but no longer used
- Can be removed in future cleanup

## Benefits vs. Old System

| Feature | Old System | OR-Tools VRP |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Algorithm** | Custom nearest-neighbor + 2-opt | Professional constraint programming |
| **Impossible Routes** | ❌ Fails completely | ✅ Drops nodes with penalty |
| **Optimization Goal** | Distance-based | ✅ Time-based (more realistic) |
| **Constraint Handling** | Manual checks | ✅ Built-in constraint solver |
| **Route Quality** | Mediocre (59 trucks!) | ✅ Industrial-grade optimization |
| **Time Windows** | Estimated poorly | ✅ Precise time tracking |
| **Multiple Strategies** | ❌ Single approach | ✅ Multiple search heuristics |

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Basic Test
```bash
# Upload your Excel file through the UI
# Click "Optimize Routes" 
# Expected: Much better route quality with fewer trucks
```

### 2. Expected Improvements
- **Truck Count**: Should drop from ~59 to ~5-10 trucks
- **Distance Balance**: Routes should have similar distances
- **No Outliers**: No 1,300-mile single-stop routes
- **Weight Utilization**: Better capacity usage per truck
- **Time Compliance**: All routes within 12-hour limit

### 3. Monitor Console
Look for:
```
[OR-Tools] Starting VRP optimization...
[OR-Tools] Solution found! Objective: XXXXX
[OR-Tools] Generated X routes
```

### 4. Edge Cases to Test
- ✅ 100+ stop file (should handle gracefully)
- ✅ Impossible weight constraints (should drop nodes)
- ✅ Very tight time windows (should optimize or drop)
- ✅ Missing geocodes (should skip those stops)

## Configuration

### Default Parameters (in UI):
- **Max Weight**: 52,000 lbs
- **Max Drive Time**: 12 hours (720 minutes)
- **Service Time per Stop**: 30 minutes

### Advanced Tuning (in code):
```python
# vrp_solver.py, line ~275-280
search_parameters.time_limit.seconds = 30  # Optimization time limit
penalty = 100000  # Node dropping penalty (higher = less dropping)
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert to old system:

1. Update `app/main.py` line 34:
   ```python
   from .route_optimizer import Stop, Route, plan_routes
   ```

2. Update `app/main.py` line ~795:
   ```python
   routes = plan_routes(...)
   ```

3. Restart backend server

## Next Steps

### Phase 3 Enhancements (Optional):
1. **Row-by-row Distance Matrix**: Avoid Google Maps 100-element limit
2. **Pickle Caching**: Faster cache serialization for complex objects
3. **State-based Clustering**: Pre-group by geographic regions
4. **Dynamic Vehicle Count**: Auto-determine optimal number of trucks
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live optimization progress

## Performance Metrics

### Before (Custom Algorithm):
- 107 stops → 59 trucks (1.8 stops/truck)
- Truck 2: 1,306 miles (single stop!)
- Truck 1: 420 miles
- Inconsistent weights (some showing 0 lbs)

### After (OR-Tools):
- Expected: 107 stops → ~5-10 trucks (~10-20 stops/truck)
- Balanced routes: ~600-800 miles each
- Proper weight distribution
- No outlier routes

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No solution found"
- **Cause**: Constraints too tight
- **Fix**: Increase max_drive_time or max_weight_per_truck

### Issue: "Many nodes dropped"
- **Cause**: Impossible to route within constraints
- **Fix**: Review dropped locations, adjust constraints

### Issue: "Optimization timeout"
- **Cause**: Large dataset (150+ stops)
- **Fix**: Increase time_limit in search_parameters

### Issue: Import error
- **Cause**: OR-Tools not installed
- **Fix**: `pip install ortools`
